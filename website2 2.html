<h1><b>movement</b></h1>

<p>White moves first, after which players alternate turns, moving one piece per turn, except for castling, when two pieces are moved.
A piece is moved to either an unoccupied square or one occupied by an opponent's piece, which is captured and removed from play.
With the sole exception of en passant, all pieces capture by moving to the square that the opponent's piece occupies.
Moving is compulsory; a player may not skip a turn, even when having to move is detrimental.
Each piece has its own way of moving.
In the diagrams, the dots mark the squares to which the piece can move if there are no intervening piece(s) of either color (except the knight, which leaps over any intervening pieces).
All pieces except the pawn can capture an enemy piece if it is located on a square to which they would be able to move if the square was unoccupied.
The squares on which pawns can capture enemy pieces are marked in the diagram with black crosses.</p>

<h1><b>check and checkmate</b></h1>
<br>
<p>When a king is under immediate attack, it is said to be in check. A move in response to a check is legal only if it results in a position where the king is no longer in check. This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack. Castling is not a permissible response to a check.[1]
The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no legal way to get it out of check. It is never legal for a player to make a move that puts or leaves the player's own king in check. In casual games, it is common to announce "check" when putting the opponent's king in check, but this is not required by the rules of chess and is not usually done in tournaments.</p>
